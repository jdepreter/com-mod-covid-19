Our model compared to real data

First let's see what happens if we let COVID-19 do its thing:

![Model No Lockdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/model_no_lockdown.gif?raw=true)

Hmm quite a "few more" infections, let's take a closer look and compare both models:

- Difference in infections

![Diff Infections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master//img/Infected_lockdown_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in hospitalizations (no ic)

![Diff Hospital](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/Hospital_lockdown_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in intensive care

![Diff IC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/IC_lockdown_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in deaths

![Diff Death](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/Dead_lockdown_diff.png?raw=true)

I think it's safe to say, the lockdown measures were necessary.

For our next scenario, we take a look at the so called "lockdown parties"

To achieve the desired effect, we increased the contact matrix for adolescents between 18 and 25 years of age the day before, on and after the lockdown was put in place.

Hmm... At first sight they seem to have a very small effect. Let's take a closed look.

- Difference in infections

![Party Infections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/infected_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in hospitalizations (no ic)

![Diff Hospital](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/hospital_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in intensive care

![Diff IC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/ic_diff.png?raw=true)

- Difference in deaths

![Diff Death](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdepreter/com-mod-covid-19/master/img/death_diff.png?raw=true)


Although the difference is small, it did cost the lifes of about 30 people...
